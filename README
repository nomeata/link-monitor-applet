1. About Link Monitor Applet

	Link Monitor Applet is a GNOME Panel Applet displaying the
	round-trip time to a set of hosts in a bar graph.

	Link Monitor Applet features include:

		* A line graph able to display up to one week of
		  round-trip time data
		* Country flags and names
		* Full ICMP and ICMPv6 support
		* HIG 2.0 compliance

2. Dependencies

	Mandatory:

		* GTK+ (version 2.12.0 or superior)
		  http://www.gtk.org/

		* GNOME (version 2.6.0 or superior)
		  http://www.gnome.org/

	Optional:

		* for country information support:

		  GeoIP
		  http://www.maxmind.com/geoip/

		  and a GTK+ SVG loader, for instance:

		  librsvg (version 2.0 or superior)
		  http://librsvg.sourceforge.net/

3. Installation instructions

	To configure, build and install Link Monitor Applet, use the
	following commands:

		./jb configure
		./jb build
		sudo ./jb install

	Note that a number of settings can be passed to the configure
	stage, for instance:

		./jb configure prefix=/opt cflags=-O3 geoip=no

	For details, use:

		./jb help

	For more informations about JB (the Jean-Yves Lefort's Build
	System), read jbsrc/lib/README.

	IMPORTANT:

		* The install phase will enable the setuid bit on the
		  link-monitor-applet binary (root privileges are
		  needed to create the ICMP and ICMPv6 sockets upon
		  applet startup; they will be dropped after that
		  step). You therefore need to run the install stage
		  as root, even for installing Link Monitor Applet in
		  your home directory.

		* Due to a bug in bonobo-activation
		  (http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=151082),
		  your session must be restarted after installing Link
		  Monitor Applet.
