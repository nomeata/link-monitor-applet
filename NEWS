3.0					February 20, 2008

	* The tooltip graphs have been merged into a single larger
	  graph. This new graph features many improvements, such as
	  the elimination of the staircase effect that was visible
	  with large echo delays, a configurable span, a better
	  appearance, and more.
	* The appearance of the applet bar graph has been improved
	* Host colors are now configurable
	* Time settings are now entered using sliders; these sliders
	  are non-linear and allow to easily choose an appropriate
	  value without having to use the keyboard
	* The reply timeout setting has been removed; the timeout is
	  now automatically computed from the maximum round-trip time
	* The minimum delay between echo requests has been lowered to
	  200 ms
	* ICMP/ICMPv6 error messages (destination unreachable, etc)
	  are now handled properly and displayed in the tooltip
	* ICMP/ICMPv6 packet sizes have been reduced to the smallest
	  possible value (no payload); they are 12 bytes smaller than
	  in the previous version
	* Incoming ICMP packets having an invalid checksum are now
	  ignored
	* A crash that occurred when the Ubuntu Human GTK+ theme was
	  in use has been worked around (thanks to Tomáš Hnyk for his
	  help); I believe that this crash was caused by a bug in the
	  Human theme engine
	* libeel is no longer used since its API is not stable
	* The build system has been changed from the GNU Autotools to
	  JB (the Jean-Yves Lefort's Build System)
	* The documentation is now licensed under the terms of the GNU
	  Free Documentation License version 1.2
	* Updated translation: French
	* New translation: Italian (Gabriele Vivinetto)
