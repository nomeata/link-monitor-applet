1. Motivation

	JB is the result of my long-standing dissatisfaction with the
	GNU Autotools. It makes my programmer's life easier, for
	reasons that I will not bother enumerating here.

2. Dependencies

	Regardless of the package dependencies, JB requires a C
	compiler and the GLib library (version 2.8 or superior).

3. Customizing the bootstrap compilation

	The first time ./jb is run, it bootstraps itself by compiling
	the real JB program, which is written in C. If you need to
	influence the way this program is compiled, you can set the
	jb_cc, jb_cflags, jb_cppflags and jb_ldflags environment
	variables, for instance:

		jb_cc=gcc jb_cflags=-g ./jb configure

	Note that these environment variables are only used to compile
	the JB program. To specify compilation options for the
	package, use:

		./jb configure cc=gcc cflags=-g

4. Log files

	You can check what JB is doing by reviewing the build/*.log
	files. Each action has its own log file (configure.log,
	build.log, ...).

5. Redirecting the installation

	A number of packaging systems rely on the Automake DESTDIR
	facility, which allows to install the package in a temporary
	directory rather than directly in its final location.

	JB supports that functionality. To redirect the installation
	to a different directory, pass the destdir variable to the
	configure stage, for instance:

		./jb configure destdir=/my/temp/dir

	As with Automake, the destdir setting does not influence the
	idea that the package has of its installation location.
